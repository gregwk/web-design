    <h2>Contrast Ratios</h2>
    <p>
      WCAG 2.0 level AA requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal
      text and 3:1 for large text (see WebAIM.org). In the color blocks below,
      the light grey, the orange, and the violate all have a poor contrast ratio
      with white. Tomato and light sea green have a ratio that is close to 3, so
      they do not quite make the cut for the bold text. Dodger blue and gray
      have ratios above 3 but less than 4, so they are not acceptable for normal
      white text, but they are fine for large or bold text. Slate Blue is the
      only base color that has an acceptable ratio for normal white text.
    </p>

    <p>
      To check the accessibility of text in Firefox, open the developer tools,
      chose "Accessibility" and then click the icon to the left (accessible
      object picker). Now when you hover over some text, you will see the
      contrast ratio of the text with the background.
    </p>

    <h2>Bad Color Combinations</h2>
    <p>
      These color combinations are sometimes used on websites to grab the
      reader's attention, but they are notoriously difficult to read.
    </p>

    <h3>Yellow on Green</h3>
    <div class="yellow-on-green">Yellow on Green</div>
    <p>
      Hues that are right next to each other on the color wheel are typically
      difficult to read when one is used as text and the other as a background.
      Yellow and green can be tempting to use together because they both grab
      your attention (especially if bright green is used). Both this combination
      is quite difficult to read and should be avoided as a rule.
    </p>

    <h3>Green on Red</h3>
    <div class="green-on-red">Green on Red</div>
    <p>
      Green and red side-by-side are very hard on the eyes. I lightened up the
      green significantly here but it is still difficult to read. More
      importantly, red-green colorblindness is the most common type of
      colorblindness. So you should always avoid green text on a red background
      (and vice-versa), but you should also be careful any time you are
      considering using both colors side-by-side on your website. Try to keep
      them separated with another, preferably neutral, color.
    </p>

    <h3>Purple on Green</h3>
    <div class="purple-on-green">Purple on Green</div>
    <p>
      Purple and green is a popular color combination, but it shares many of the
      problems that red and green have, so be careful when using this
      combination on your website, and do not use purple text on a green
      background.
    </p>

    <h3>Red on Black</h3>
    <div class="red-on-black">Red on Black</div>
    <p>
      Many students <span style="font-style: italic">love</span> this
      combination for websites, and it's not surprising â€“ the combination
      invokes intensity and the occult. But red text on a black background is
      extremely difficult to read, and for those with red-green colorblindness,
      it's nearly impossible. Try this experiment: Go to the accessibility tool
      in Firefox and simulate achromatopsia. This will effectively eliminate all
      color on this web page. Now look at the red text on the black background,
      you can barely see it. The contrast ratio is less than 2.5.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to see a site that handles red and black well, take a look at
      <a href="https://dvd.com" target="_blank">DVD.com</a>. They're logo is
      red, so they want to keep red as the accent color, and they header and
      footer on most of the pages is black, but they avoid ever using red text
      on a black background.
    </p>
    <h4>Pure Black Backgrounds</h4>
    <p>
      Some web designers think that you should avoid pure black backgrounds in
      general, because no color can compete with black's intensity. Some of
      these people recommend using something close to black, but not black. An
      example would be the header from
      <a href="https://amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon's website</a>. At
      first glance it looks black, but if you examine it closely its actually a
      very dark shade of blue-green. The idea is that it's easier on the eyes,
      and the logo, especially the yellow arrow, does not look as jarring as it
      would on a pure black background.
    </p>

    <h3>Blue on Red</h3>
    <div class="blue-on-red">Blue on Red</div>
    <p>
      Blue text on a red background is notoriously hard to read, and it has
      something to do with the way our eyes work. When we see blue text on a red
      background, our brains are perceiving (or trying to percieve) a 3D image
      from the 2D image in front of them. This also occurs with green text on
      red backgrounds. The effect is know as chromostereopsis. Needless to say,
      this effect plays havoc with readability.
    </p>

    <h2>An Example Color Problem</h2>
    <p>
      In one of my courses, a student wanted to create a text logo involving red
      on a black background. The text logo looked something like this.
    </p>
    <div class="coding-books-logo">
      Coding<br />
      <span style="color: white">&lt;/&gt;</span> Books
    </div>
    <p>
      Not only does this font involve red text on a black background, but the
      text is small and thin, especially for a logo. Logo text is usually
      larger, bolder, and involves a font that looks good when it is both large
      and bold. The student did not want to give up the red color altogether
      because he had already commited to it elsewhere on the site. We mitigated
      the readability problem by chosing a background that was not quite black,
      increasing the font size and weight, and making one of the words gray
      instead of red. Finally, we chose a font (Nunito) that looked distinctive
      enough for a logo. This was the result.
