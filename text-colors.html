    <h2>Contrast Ratios</h2>
    <p>
      WCAG 2.0 level AA requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal
      text and 3:1 for large text (see WebAIM.org). In the color blocks below,
      the light grey, the orange, and the violate all have a poor contrast ratio
      with white. Tomato and light sea green have a ratio that is close to 3, so
      they do not quite make the cut for the bold text. Dodger blue and gray
      have ratios above 3 but less than 4, so they are not acceptable for normal
      white text, but they are fine for large or bold text. Slate Blue is the
      only base color that has an acceptable ratio for normal white text.
    </p>

    <p>
      To check the accessibility of text in Firefox, open the developer tools,
      chose "Accessibility" and then click the icon to the left (accessible
      object picker). Now when you hover over some text, you will see the
      contrast ratio of the text with the background.
    </p>

    <h2>Bad Color Combinations</h2>
    <p>
      These color combinations are sometimes used on websites to grab the
      reader's attention, but they are notoriously difficult to read.
    </p>

    <h3>Yellow on Green</h3>
    <div class="color-sample yellow-on-green">Yellow on Green</div>
    <p>
      Hues that are right next to each other on the color wheel are typically
      difficult to read when one is used as text and the other as a background.
      Yellow and green can be tempting to use together because they both grab
      your attention, especially if bright green is used, but this combination
      is difficult to read and should be avoided.
    </p>

    <h3>Green on Red</h3>
    <div class="color-sample green-on-red">Green on Red</div>
    <p>
      There is a saying in the fashion industry that goes: "Red and green should
      never be seen without a color in between." I'm not sure about fashion, but
      it's a good rule of thumb for websites. Any time your site has both red
      and green colors on it, you need to consider how it would look to someone
      with red-green color blindness, which is the most common form. You should
      never put green text on a red background or vice versa. This is hard on
      the eyes even for someone without red-green color blindness.
    </p>

    <h3>Purple on Green</h3>
    <div class="color-sample purple-on-green">Purple on Green</div>
    <p>
      Purple and green is a popular color combination, but it shares many of the
      problems that red and green have, so be careful when using this
      combination on your website. Do not use purple text on a green background.
    </p>

    <h3>Red on Black</h3>
    <div class="color-sample red-on-black">Red on Black</div>
    <p>
      Many students <span style="font-style: italic">love</span> this
      combination for websites, and it's not surprising. The combination invokes
      intensity, drama, danger, and mystery. The colors are very popular in
      advertising. But red text on a black background is extremely difficult to
      read, and for those with red-green colorblindness, it can be nearly
      impossible. Try this experiment: Go to the accessibility tool in Firefox
      and simulate achromatopsia. This will effectively eliminate all color on
      this web page. Now look at the red text on the black background, you can
      barely see it. The contrast ratio is less than 2.5.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keep in mind that, for all of the combinations listed here, it does not
      mean you must avoid using both colors on your site at the same time, just
      take care when using them next to each other, and do not use one for text
      when you are using the other for a background. If you want to see a site
      that handles red and black well, take a look at
      <a href="https://dvd.com" target="_blank">DVD.com</a>. The logo is red, so
      they want to keep red as the accent color, and both the header and footer
      on most pages are black, but they are able to avoid red text on a black
      background.
    </p>
    <h4>Pure Black Backgrounds</h4>
    <p>
      Some web designers think that you should avoid pure black backgrounds in
      general, because no color can compete with black's intensity. This is
      probably a good idea. Some people recommend using a color close to black,
      but not pure black. An example would be the header from
      <a href="https://amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon's website</a>. At
      first glance it looks black, but if you examine it closely its actually a
      very dark shade of blue-green. The idea is that it's easier on the eyes,
      and the logo, especially the yellow arrow, does not look as jarring as it
      would on a pure black background.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, when you have a black or near-black background, consider making the
      text less intense also. For example, try using off-white instead of white,
      or lemon-yellow instead of yellow. Take a look at your favorite text
      editor in dark mode. Chances are that you will find that the background is
      not pure black and the text is not pure white.
    </p>

    <h3>Blue on Red</h3>
    <div class="color-sample blue-on-red">Blue on Red</div>
    <p>
      Blue text on a red background is notoriously hard to read because it
      causes a "stereo effect" on our eyes. When we see blue text on a red
      background, our brains are trying to translate the 2D image into a 3D
      image, making the text seem to pop out and vibrate. This effeect also
      occurs with green text on red backgrounds. The effect is known as
      <strong>chromostereopsis</strong>, and needless to say, it plays havoc
      with readability.
    </p>

    <h3>Other Combinations to Avoid</h3>
    <p>
      Some sites that discuss color blindness also suggest avoiding these other
      color combinations:
    </p>
    <ul class="bulleted-list">
      <li>Green &amp; Red</li>
      <li>Green &amp; Brown</li>
      <li>Blue &amp; Purple</li>
      <li>Green &amp; Blue</li>
      <li>Light Green &amp; Yellow</li>
      <li>Blue &amp; Grey</li>
      <li>Green &amp; Grey</li>
      <li>Green &amp; Black</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Along with these combinations and those we've already mentioned above, I
      would add a few more general things to consider when thinking about text
      and backgrounds.
    </p>
    <ul class="bulleted-list">
      <li>
        Avoid putting text directly on a busy background, such as an image. If
        you want to put text over an image, which is a common thing to do, put
        it on its own colored rectangle or use a semi-transparent overlay.
      </li>
      <li>
        Do not use intense (highly saturated) colors for both your text and
        background. You should probably reserve intense colors for accent
        colors, such as the background colors of your primary buttons and
        possibly your secondary buttons.
      </li>
      <li>
        For your default text color, consider sticking with near black or near
        white.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Visual Accessibility Guidelines</h2>

    <p>
      We have talked a lot about what <em>not</em> to do regarding text and
      background colors, but what <em>should</em> we do? Here are some visual
      accessibility guidelines you should follow.
    </p>

    <ul class="bulleted-list">
      <li>
        <strong>Always Use “alt” Tags</strong> – Using alt tags for all of your
        images is a simple web development guideline that you should always
        follow for visual accessibility. Also, images can be broken.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Use True Text; Not Text in Graphics</strong> – To make text more
        legible when enlarged, use true text as much as possible, rather than
        text in graphics. (<a
          href="https://webaim.org/articles/visual/lowvision"
          >WebAIM</a
        >)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Maximize Contrast</strong> – To the extent possible, maximize
        the contrast of your web pages, including graphics, fonts, and
        backgrounds. (<a href="https://webaim.org/articles/visual/lowvision"
          >WebAIM</a
        >)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Do Not Rely on Color</strong> – Ensure that color is not used as
        the only means of indicating or differentiating meaning or content.
        <em
          >Color should never be used as the only means of conveying important
          information!</em
        >
        (<a href="https://webaim.org/articles/visual/lowvision">WebAIM</a>)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This last bullet is particularly important, so lets look at a couple
      examples.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first example, both the success and failure alerts include icons
      that are associated with success and failure. They do not rely solely on
      the green and red colors to convey that information.
    </p>

    <div class="cart-updated">
      <i class="far fa-check-circle"></i> Your shopping cart has been
      successfully updated.
    </div>
    <div class="cart-not-updated">
      <i class="far fa-times-circle"></i> There was a problem trying to update
      your shopping cart.
    </div>

    <p>
      In the next example, the error on form input is highlighted with a warning
      symbol rather than just a red outline of the input field.
    </p>

    <div class="input-error">
      <span class="input-hint"> Please enter your name. </span>
      <span class="input-error-icon">
        <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i
      ></span>
    </div>

    <h3>Using Firefox for Help</h3>

    <p>
      A straightfoward approach to makeing sure your website is
      <em>fairly</em> visually accessible, particularly to color blind people,
      is to use the Firefox developer tools.
    </p>

    <ul class="bulleted-list">
      <li>Choose the Accessibility tool inside the Firefox developer tools.</li>
      <li>
        View your page using the achromatopsia simulation. Now check the
        following:
        <ul class="bulleted-list">
          <li>Can you still see all the information you want to see?</li>
          <li>Can you distinguish between primary and secondary buttons?</li>
          <li>
            Does the text still have a good contrast ratio with the background?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If the answer to all of those questions is yes, your site should be
          reasonably accessible to colorblind users.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example: Red text in Logo</h2>
    <p>
      In one of my courses, a student wanted to create a text logo involving red
      on a black background. The text logo looked something like this.
    </p>
    <div class="coding-books-logo">
      Coding<br />
      <span style="color: white">&lt;/&gt;</span> Books
    </div>
    <p>
      Not only does this font involve red text on a black background, but the
      text is small and thin. In fact, the font size of the logo text was
      actually smaller than it was for the default text of the page. Logo text
      should be larger and bolder, and you should use a font that looks good
      when it is large and bold. The student did not want to give up the red
      color altogether because he had already commited to it elsewhere on the
      site. We mitigated the readability problem by doing using some of the
      following "easy wins":
    </p>
    <ul class="bulleted-list">
      <li>Get rid of pure black background</li>
      <li>Don't make text color pure red</li>
      <li>Minimize use of red font color</li>
      <li>Increase size and weight of font</li>
      <li>Use a distinctive font (Nunito)</li>
      <li>Decrease line height</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Nunito was a font that looked good at the larger font weight. Decreasing
      the line height is standard practice with larger fonts. We also
      left-justified the text and added a space before the symbol on the second
      line. This pushed the word books over so that the bottom of the "g" on the
      first line was above the "oo" in the word Books. We've still got the
      problem of a low contrast when colors are removed, but keeping red in the
      logo text was a self-imposed requirement.
    </p>

    <div class="coding-books-logo-redux">
      Coding<br />
      <span class="coding-books-logo-symbol">&nbsp;&lt;/&gt;</span
      ><span class="coding-books-logo-gray">&nbsp;Books</span>
    </div>
    <h2>Example: Low Contrast in Book Boxes</h2>
    <p>Place another example here.</p>
    <div class="book-boxes-low-contrast">
      <div class="book-box">
        <div class="book-image"></div>
        <div class="book-title">High Fidelity</div>
        <div class="book-author">Nick Hornby</div>
